1. Validation Messages:

Added clear and specific validation error messages, such as:
"City must not be empty."
"Company Name 'xyz' already exists. Please choose a different name."
These messages ensure users understand why their input is invalid and how to correct it.
User Confirmation:

2. Added confirmation dialogs for sensitive actions like deletion and cancellation.
Example: Before deleting a client, the application prompts:
"Are you sure you want to delete this client?"
Professional Code Comments:

3. Added detailed and professional comments to the ClientViewModel class.
Comments explain the purpose of methods, commands, and validations, making the codebase more maintainable for developers.
